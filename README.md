This project is called "Hello HTTP Server" for module NODE101.

The goal of this project was to accomplish the following:

1. To learn how to implement a server using NodeJS by having the server respond to GET requests to the http://localhost:8080/ by then returning the text "Hello World"/
2. To learn how to use the server to return status codes such as status code 200.
3. To learn how to log each request path (e.g. / or /test) at the standard out (console) in Terminal.
4. To learn how to have the server indicate when it is listening and on which port.
5. To learn how to deploy our site using the "now CLI' package.

Clone the repository locally to your computer. Open up the project in Visual Studio Code. Open up Terminal, run the command "npm start" //This will load the project into the web browser. Once the server is live, go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser. You should see a message displayed on the website that says "Hello World". In addition, you should also see a "STATUS CODE: 200" message by opening up Developer Tools, then clicking on the "Network" tab. To bring down the server, simply go to the Terminal and do "Ctrl + C" to take down the localhost server.
